# GrapeTree

This is forked version of GrapeTree which will only contain the content responsible for drawing trees on the client-side. With this version, there won't be a need for hosting a server with a specific version of GrapeTree, and the software can be tailored towards your specific application.


To use GrapeTree visualization tools include the scripts found in the js folder and follow the [documentation](https://achtman-lab.github.io/GrapeTree/documentation/developer/index.html).








### Documentation

Developers may wish to look at the [JavaScript documentation](https://achtman-lab.github.io/GrapeTree/documentation/developer/index.html) (JSDoc). Here you can find the functionalities of the scripts which produce the trees.
